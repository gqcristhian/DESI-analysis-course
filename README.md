# Installation instruction for the DESI conda environment

(1) First of all, you will need conda installed. For Linux or macOS you can do:
```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

(2) After your conda is active, you can simply do:
```sh
bash setup_cosmodesi_course.sh`
```

(3) Activate your new environment as
```sh
conda activate cosmodesi_course
```

(4) If everything is successful, you can then simply run the test.py as:
```sh
python test.py
